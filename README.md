# Breakout Game

Move the paddle across & try & break as many breaks as you can in this project. Each time a brick breaks your score increases but if you miss the ball your score resets & you get an alert saying you lost. Also have rules fly in on left side which slide in & out

HTML canvas and javascrip animation api are used in this project.
